### Objective

Using TypeScript and NextJS, your challenge is to build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs), and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "http://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://goo.gl/aO3Ssc ".

Your challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty
